## ðŸš€ About Loki

Loki was created to help protect individuals and organizations, such as [reporters without borders](https://rsf.org/en), who face censorship and surveillance when trying to release information from blacked out regions. With the potential for [government media blackouts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Media_blackout) increasing, Loki provides a form of resistance against state, government, and corporate control of our data. By using encryption to vault files before uploading, users can take control of their data and protect their freedoms even when using the cloud. Additionally, knowing your rights and freedoms in the EU can help individuals fight back against manipulation and control!

This is why tools it's been adopted into the [CSI; Linux](https://csilinux.com/) operating system, built with [Debian](https://www.debian.org/) in mind and above all else supported by community like [Foxden](https://discord.gg/H4CjUqHm3Q) and the global [societal security guild](https://www.discord.gg/SAmAPUSzug).

## âœ¨ Features

Before you ask questions, do consult the Wiki first as it goes into detail about what 'Fernet' is, setting up `-vault`, etc and not reading the documentation and diving into an encryption tool **can** risk your valuable data being encrypted permanently so it's worth reading up on first!
- Encryption | `-encrypt`
- Decryption | `-decrypt`
- Keygen | `-keygen`
- Vault | `-vault`
- Config | `-config`

## ðŸ“› Security Policy

### Supported Versions

As Loki rapidly approaches the 4.x.x benchmark intended for _stable-release_ they'll be an unconventional security policy being brought into play. Consider 'security' issues as ones that risk the integrity of the end-user data in a substantial way.

 - You're able to backup your key when generating a new one, choosing not to back your key up is your fault, and not a security issue.
 - Not following documentation, and then encrypting your data beyond recovery is not a fault, nor a security issue.
